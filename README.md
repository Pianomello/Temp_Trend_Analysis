# Comparative Analysis of Historical Temperature Trends in India, China, and the United States

## ðŸ“˜ Description:

Using historical climate data, this project examines long-term temperature trends in three geographically and climatically different nations: the United States, China, and India. Histograms, KDE plots, scatterplots, and temporal line plots are among the visual exploratory techniques used in the analysis to compare the evolution of average surface temperatures across cities and countries and find patterns. The project intends to offer empirical insight into regional climate warming by utilizing data from the Global Historical Climatology Network and utilizing data visualization techniques based on Python.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
   - to compare the temporal trends and temperature distributions in China, India, and the US.
     
   - to evaluate temporal and spatial variation, especially at the city level, within the Indian nation.
     
   - to measure and illustrate trends in warming at the national level during the 20th and 21st centuries.
     
   - to establish an analytical framework for additional data-driven, climate-focused research.


## ðŸ“Š Key Insights:

   - Distribution Patterns:
        - Given its naturally warmer climate, India's temperature distribution is skewed toward higher average values than those of China and the US, according to histograms with KDE overlays. Because of its varied climate zones, the U.S. exhibits the greatest spread.
   
   - City-Level Trends:
     
   - Temporal Trends:
   - Cross-Country Comparison:







## âœ… Conclusion

   This study supports observations of global climate change by confirming that the United States, China, and India have all seen notable warming over the past century. Both regional and universal trends are revealed by the analysis, including greater variability in the U.S. and higher mean temperatures in India. These results highlight how crucial localized climate monitoring and policy action are. The project can act as a starting point for further studies that incorporate other factors like CO2 emissions, urbanization indices, or socioeconomic effects.
